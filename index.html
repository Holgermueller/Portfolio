        <h2>Hi, I'm Holger. <small>(Pronounced kinda like hole-grr)</small></h2>
        <p class="bio-text">
          I'm a front end designer and developer living in Batesville, Arkansas.
          I like art and tech, and I like to bring them together to make
          cool-looking accessable mobile responsive sites and apps.
        </p>
        <p class="bio-text">
          Originally from Upstate New York, I moved to Batesville, Arkansas
          halfway through 2022 so my wife could pursue her dream job, working at
          a small liberal arts college. Prior to Arkansas, we lived in
          Minneapolis, MN, where we endured seven years of winters. During that
          time, I earned my full-stack web developer certificate through the
          University of Minnesota's College of Continuing Education. Through
          that program, I've become proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery,
          React, Google's Cloud Firebase, MongoDB, and a few other technologies.
          My plan of attack when working on projects is to break the overall
          task into the smallest manageable pieces and build up from there. And
          I'm happiest when solutions can be accomplished with just a line or
          two of code.
        </p>
        <p class="bio-text">
          When not coding, I enjoy reading and writing, watching movies, hiking,
          and travelling. One of my longshot dreams is to visit every country on
          the planet. Some of my bucket-list destinations are Japan, New
          Zealand, Portugal, South Africa, and Iceland. So far, I've been to
          Australia, the Republic of Korea, France, Canada, and Italy. As far as
          reading goes, I've recently rediscovered my love of Science Ficiton
          and fantasy, and I've always had an affinty for Marvel Comics. With
          movies, I tend to enjoy comedies over other genres. And with music,
          I'm fond of many genres, but jazz and punk rock tend to be my
          favorites.
